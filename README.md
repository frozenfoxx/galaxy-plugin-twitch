⚠️ Make sure you know what you are doing.

Prerequisites:
* `git`

cd galaxy-plugin-twitch
pip install invoke
inv install

## Authentication

In order to use this plugin you have to be authenticated in [Twitch App](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads).

## Known issues and limitations

### Twitch app

* DB contains columns for the game time tracking, but app doesn't update them. So game time tracking is not possible until GLX implements it.
* App has some problems starting game installation process automatically.
* No support for games on MacOS.

### Plugin TODO

* Friends / chat.
* Web-based (no client) library retrieval.
